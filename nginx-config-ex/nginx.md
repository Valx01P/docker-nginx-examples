# Introduction to NGINX

NGINX is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. Initially created to handle the **C10k problem** (10,000 concurrent connections), it uses an **event-driven asynchronous architecture**, making it extremely efficient and capable of handling a large number of concurrent connections with low resource usage.

## Common Use Cases

- **Static Web Server**: Serving static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- **Reverse Proxy**: Forwarding incoming requests to backend services or microservices.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Handling HTTPS connections (decrypting traffic at the edge).
- **Content Caching**: Caching responses from backend services.

## Installation

### Installing on Linux (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
Installing from Source
Download the latest NGINX source from nginx.org/download.

Compile and install:
bash
Copy code
./configure --prefix=/etc/nginx \
            --sbin-path=/usr/sbin/nginx \
            --conf-path=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \

            --with-http_v2_module
make
sudo make install
NGINX Configuration Basics
NGINXâ€™s primary configuration file is typically located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. It can include other configuration files (commonly in /etc/nginx/conf.d/ or /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/).

Configuration File Structure
Below is a typical nginx.conf file structure:

nginx
Copy code
user  nginx;             # The user or group running NGINX worker processes
worker_processes  auto;  # Automatically scale worker processes based on CPU cores

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;  # Error log file location
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;            # PID file location

events {
    worker_connections  1024;  # Maximum connections per worker process
}

http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;  # Recognizes standard MIME types
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;

    # Gzip settings (optional)
    gzip on;
    gzip_comp_level 5;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript;

    # Server block for virtual host
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  example.com www.example.com;

        location / {
            root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
}
Key Sections:
events block: Configures global settings for the event model.
http block: Contains HTTP-related settings, including server blocks, logging, Gzip, and caching.
server block: Defines virtual hosts (multiple server blocks per NGINX instance).
location block: Defines request processing for specific URI patterns.
Important Directives & Configuration Blocks
http Context
include: Includes other configuration snippets.
sendfile on;: Enables efficient file transmission.
keepalive_timeout 65;: Sets HTTP connection keep-alive duration.
gzip: Controls Gzip compression for responses.
log_format / access_log: Customizes request logging format and location.
server Context
listen: Specifies the port and IP/interface for the server block.
server_name: Specifies domain names handled by this block.
ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key: Enables HTTPS.
location Context
proxy_pass: Forwards requests to a backend server.
try_files: Attempts to serve files in a specific order or returns an error.
SSL/TLS Configuration
To enable HTTPS in NGINX, include the following in your server block:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key;

    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html;
    }
}
For Let's Encrypt certificates, the typical locations are:

/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
Reverse Proxy Configuration
A simple reverse proxy setup:

nginx
Copy code
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:5000/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Host               $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto  $scheme;
    }
}
Load Balancing with Upstreams
NGINX supports various load balancing algorithms (e.g., least_conn, ip_hash).

nginx
Copy code
http {
    upstream backend_pool {
        least_conn;
        server backend1.example.com max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
        server backend2.example.com max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_pool;
        }
    }
}
Advanced Configurations
URL Rewriting
nginx
Copy code
location /old-page {
    rewrite ^/old-page$ /new-page permanent;
}
Custom Error Pages
nginx
Copy code
server {
    error_page 404 /custom_404.html;
    location = /custom_404.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html/errors;
    }
}
Rate Limiting
nginx
Copy code
http {
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=5r/s;

    server {
        location / {
            limit_req zone=one burst=10 nodelay;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        }
    }
}
Conclusion
NGINX is a versatile, high-performance server capable of handling a wide range of tasks. Mastering its configuration ensures efficient deployments, whether for static content, reverse proxies, or load balancing. Always test configurations (nginx -t) and reload gracefully (systemctl reload nginx) to avoid downtime.
